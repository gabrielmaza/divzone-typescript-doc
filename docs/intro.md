# Getting Started

Getting started with **DivZone Template**.

---

Introducing our **new customizable landing page template**, designed to showcase your brand and drive conversions. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Vite, this template provides a modern and efficient way to build your online presence.

## System requirements

- Node.js 14.15 or higher
- Yarn or npm
- A code editor of your choice

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies and tools before using the template. With its intuitive structure and user-friendly customization options, our template will help you create a stunning landing page in no time.

## Install and run the project

- Clone the repository or download the source code and extract it to a folder on your computer: **https://github.com/gabrielmaza/divzone-typescript**
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal.
- Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in the terminal.

The development server should start and display a URL in the terminal where you can view the project. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL to see the landing page in action.
You can now make changes to the code and see the updates live in your browser. The development server will automatically reload the page when you save changes to the code.

That's it! You can now start customizing the template and building your own landing page.
