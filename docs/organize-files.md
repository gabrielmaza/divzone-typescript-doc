The **divzone-nextjs-theme** folder contains the source code for your landing page template. Inside the `src` folder, you'll find several subfolders that organize the different parts of your template:

## pages

This directory contains the `Next.js` page components.

## public

The `public` directory is where you can store static assets such as images and SVG files.

## hooks

The `hooks` folder contains custom React hooks that provide additional functionality and state management for your components.

## img

Place image files in this directory.

## src

The `src` directory is the main source code directory of your Next.js application.

## app

This directory includes the application-level components.

## components

The `components` directory contains reusable components used throughout the template.

## hooks

Custom React hooks can be placed in this directory.

## shared

The `shared` directory is for shared utility functions or components.

This file structure organizes your codebase, making it easier to navigate and locate specific files when working on your Next.js and TypeScript landing page project.
