The `Home.page.tsx` file is the main landing page for the project, located in the "pages" folder. This page consists of several components that are used to build the overall structure of the page.

The first component used is the Navbar, which contains links to other pages in the project. The Navbar also has a fixed position at the top of the page, which allows for easy navigation regardless of where the user is on the page.
The next component is the Main section, which is the main content of the page. This section may contain images, text, or other media that are relevant to the project.

Following the Main section is the Benefits section, which highlights the benefits of the project. This section may include features or advantages that the project offers, and can help persuade users to engage with the project.
The Services section is the next component, which describes the specific services or products that the project offers. This section can include details about pricing, features, or other information that is important for users to know.

The ContactUs section provides a way for users to get in touch with the project team. This section may include a form, email address, or other contact information that allows users to ask questions or get support.
Finally, the Footer component contains links to important pages or resources related to the project, such as social media profiles, terms of service, or privacy policies.

In addition to these components, the `Home.page.tsx` file also includes code that sets up the page's functionality. For example, the useEffect hook is used to detect when the user scrolls and update the selectedPage state accordingly. The useState hook is used to manage the state of the page, such as whether the user is at the top of the page or not.

Overall, the `Home.page.tsx` file is a key component of the project and serves as the main entry point for users. By using a combination of components and functionality, the page is able to provide an engaging and informative experience for users.
